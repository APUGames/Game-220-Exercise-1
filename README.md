## Audio Clip Analysis


### Car Horns

Let's say you're designing a casual racing game, and you're looking for car horn sound effects. Of the three below, describe the pros and cons of each clip. Try to use objective descriptors (Volume, EQ balance, Attack and Decay, Noise, Reverberation) to describe each clip:

- [car-horn__a.wav](/assets/car-horn__a.wav?raw=1)
- [car-horn__b.wav](/assets/car-horn__b.wav?raw=1)
- [car-horn__c.wav](/assets/car-horn__c.wav?raw=1)

#### Your Answer
<!-- Write your answer here -->

- [car-horn__a.wav](/assets/car-horn__a.wav?raw=1)
	-The volume of this clip is very loud. The quality is not the most clear. The attack is quick and concise, as expected of a car horn. The decay is the same. There is little to no noise in this clip.
	-Pros: Loud, No Noise, Quick Attack
	-Cons: Low Quality, Decay too short
- [car-horn__b.wav](/assets/car-horn__b.wav?raw=1)
	-The volume of this clip is somewhat soft. The attack is quick, and lingers on for a few more car horns. There is little to no noise in this clip.
	-Pros: Many car horn samples to choose from
	-Cons: Low volume
- [car-horn__c.wav](/assets/car-horn__c.wav?raw=1)
	-The volume of this clip is loud. Although the quality of the horn itself is good, there is a lot of noise in the background. The attack and decay are slow.
	-Pros: Good volume, has the whole horn sound
	-Cons: Noise

### Identifying EQ Problems

Below is a car engine audio clip, and two two versions of the same clip, each one with different EQ changes applied. Describe the EQ differences you hear between the clips.

- [car-engine.wav](/assets/car-engine.wav?raw=1) 
- [car-engine__eq1](/assets/car-engine__eq1.wav?raw=1)
- [car-engine__eq2](/assets/car-engine__eq2.wav?raw=1)

#### Your Answer
<!-- Write your answer here -->

- [car-engine__eq1](/assets/car-engine__eq1.wav?raw=1)
	- The difference between the original audio file and this one is that this clip's waveform probably has a lower amplitude than the original. The sound is low, and the original low sounds have been boosted.
- [car-engine__eq2](/assets/car-engine__eq2.wav?raw=1)
	- The difference between the original audio file and this one is that this clip is much more higher pitched than the original clip.

## Waveform Analysis

As we learn to work with audio tools, we'll use waveforms to make quick visual assesments of audio files and clips.

Match the following waveforms to the description you think most likely describes the content.

- A. ![Waveform A](/assets/waveform-a.png)
- B. ![Waveform B](/assets/waveform-b.png)
- C. ![Waveform C](/assets/waveform-c.png)
- D. ![Waveform D](/assets/waveform-d.png)

Fill out the first column of this table with the letter of the waveform you think matches the description.
