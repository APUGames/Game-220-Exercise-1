## Audio Clip Analysis


### Car Horns

Let's say you're designing a casual racing game, and you're looking for car horn sound effects. Of the three below, describe the pros and cons of each clip. Try to use objective descriptors (Volume, EQ balance, Attack and Decay, Noise, Reverberation) to describe each clip:

- [car-horn__a.wav](/assets/car-horn__a.wav?raw=1)
- [car-horn__b.wav](/assets/car-horn__b.wav?raw=1)
- [car-horn__c.wav](/assets/car-horn__c.wav?raw=1)

#### Your Answer
<!--
A) Sound is loud, and there's no noise but there's little decay and happens so quickly that it melds together a bit.
B) Attack and decay is better and the spacing between the honks allows for clarity, but the volume is way too low.
C) Nails every category except for sound, there;s clearly traffic going on in the background.
-->

### Identifying EQ Problems

Below is a car engine audio clip, and two two versions of the same clip, each one with different EQ changes applied. Describe the EQ differences you hear between the clips.

- [car-engine.wav](/assets/car-engine.wav?raw=1) 
- [car-engine__eq1](/assets/car-engine__eq1.wav?raw=1)
- [car-engine__eq2](/assets/car-engine__eq2.wav?raw=1)

#### Your Answer
<!--
EQ1) Lower pitch
EQ2) Higher pitch
 -->

## Waveform Analysis

As we learn to work with audio tools, we'll use waveforms to make quick visual assesments of audio files and clips.

Match the following waveforms to the description you think most likely describes the content.

- A. ![Waveform A](/assets/waveform-a.png)
- B. ![Waveform B](/assets/waveform-b.png)
- C. ![Waveform C](/assets/waveform-c.png)
- D. ![Waveform D](/assets/waveform-d.png)

Fill out the first column of this table with the letter of the waveform you think matches the description.
