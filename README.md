## Audio Clip Analysis


### Car Horns

Let's say you're designing a casual racing game, and you're looking for car horn sound effects. Of the three below, describe the pros and cons of each clip. Try to use objective descriptors (Volume, EQ balance, Attack and Decay, Noise, Reverberation) to describe each clip:

- [car-horn__a.wav](/assets/car-horn__a.wav?raw=1)
- [car-horn__b.wav](/assets/car-horn__b.wav?raw=1)
- [car-horn__c.wav](/assets/car-horn__c.wav?raw=1)

#### Your Answer
Car horn A
  2 sharp horns, the horn seems to have 2 different notes simultaneously with a fast attack and equally fast decay.
  Pro: Clear
       Loud
       Distinguishable
  Con: Harsh
       
Car horn B
  4 horns total, each horn has fast attack and decay with a longer hold with each subsequent horn. 
  Pro: Distinguishable
       Good Volume
  Con: Background Noise 
       Muffled

Car horn C
  2 horns total, each horn has a fast attack and decay, the first horn being shorter than the subsequent horn.
  Pro: Good Volume
  Con: Muffled
       Background Noise
       Cluttered
       
### Identifying EQ Problems

Below is a car engine audio clip, and two two versions of the same clip, each one with different EQ changes applied. Describe the EQ differences you hear between the clips.

- [car-engine.wav](/assets/car-engine.wav?raw=1) 
- [car-engine__eq1](/assets/car-engine__eq1.wav?raw=1)
- [car-engine__eq2](/assets/car-engine__eq2.wav?raw=1)

#### Your Answer
EQ1
  Lower pitched
  Sounds muffled, possibly lofi
  
EQ2
  Higher pitched
  Tinny
  

## Waveform Analysis

As we learn to work with audio tools, we'll use waveforms to make quick visual assesments of audio files and clips.

Match the following waveforms to the description you think most likely describes the content.

- A. ![Waveform A](/assets/waveform-a.png)
- B. ![Waveform B](/assets/waveform-b.png)
- C. ![Waveform C](/assets/waveform-c.png)
- D. ![Waveform D](/assets/waveform-d.png)

Fill out the first column of this table with the letter of the waveform you think matches the description.
